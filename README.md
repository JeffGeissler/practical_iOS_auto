# practical_iOS_auto

Practical iOS automation framework for building powerful workflows without publishing to the App Store. This project enables iOS users to create sophisticated automation by combining Apple Shortcuts with a Python backend service.

## Overview

**practical_iOS_auto** is a distributed automation system that leverages Apple's Shortcuts app to trigger custom logic running on a Python service. Instead of being limited to App Store distribution, this approach provides flexibility to run custom automation workflows locally or in the cloud.

## Architecture

The system follows a modular, layered architecture:

```
Apple Shortcut
    ↓ (HTTP request)
curl / HTTP Client
    ↓
Python Service (Local or Cloud)
    ↓
Handler (Modular Logic)
    ↓
Output Options
    ├── GitHub (repo updates, issues, PRs)
    ├── JSON (structured data)
    └── Notifications (alerts, messages)
```

### Components

- **Apple Shortcut**: Entry point triggering the automation workflow
- **HTTP Client (curl)**: Sends requests from the Shortcut to the backend service
- **Python Service**: Backend processing layer (can run locally or on cloud infrastructure)
- **Handler**: Modular business logic processing requests and orchestrating workflows
- **Output**: Flexible output destinations including GitHub integration, JSON exports, and system notifications

## Requirements

- iOS device with Shortcuts app
- Python 3.8+
- HTTP connectivity between iOS device and Python service
